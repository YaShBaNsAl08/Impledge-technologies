Word composition problem

Here I written 2 solutions:
Solution.cpp : In this I solve the problem whithout using file handling in C++.
Solution2.py : In this I solve the problem using file handling in python.

In both the solution approach will be same, I use trie data structure because it is tree based implementation that enables efficient retrieval of a key from pool of large datasets of string. In trie we can insert and find strings in O(n) times where n represent the length of a single word and easily print all words in alphabetical order.
In code there is a function (findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict) which is present in class (Solution) to find the concatenated words in a dataset.
Solution.cpp, C++ code user have to input the words as an input and in Solution2.py, python code user have a text file for input.
Python code having class (Trie) for making a tree and searching a required target.
C++ code having structure (Trie) and (compare) for making a tree and serching a required target.
